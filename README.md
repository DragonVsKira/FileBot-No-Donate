# FileBot - No Donate

After being bothered every time I used the program, I decided to do something about it.

![Donate Dialog](docs/donate.png)

I have nothing against *donations*, but this kind of approach I find particularly annoying.

## Requirements
* Windows 10
* [FileBot 4.7.9](https://sourceforge.net/projects/filebot/files/filebot/FileBot_4.7.9/)

## How to install

Just replace the files below in the folder `%ProgramFiles%\FileBot`.
* filebot.launcher.l4j.ini
* filebot.platform.launcher.l4j.ini

## Troubleshooting

If your rename history is too large, you may also need to delete the file `history.xml` in the folder `%APPDATA%\FileBot`.
